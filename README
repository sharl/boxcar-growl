* Troubleshooting

If you get the following error when running the script:

        "can't verify ssl peers without knowing which certificate authorities to trust"

Then you need to install and/or update your LWP::UserAgent and Mozilla::CA perl libraries[1]. You can do this as follows:

     $ sudo cpan
     install LWP::UserAgent Mozilla::CA
